# `04` Access Array Values

Arrays are a collection or list of data, it's used to store related data all together, for example, we can store a list of cars, or a list of people, and so on. 

In this project, we are going to use arrays to store the different sentences that will be used in our excuse.

In order to use the data stored in our array, we have to access the elements. The way you access to array values is by using their position in the array. Here is an example of how to access array values:

```js
// On this example we are going to access the second value of the array ("corolla")
let cars = ["mustang", "corolla", "accent"];
console.log(cars[1]); // This will print corolla
```

> Notice the second element is located in the position 1.

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Remove all the code added in the previous steps.

2. Add the the following array in your code:

```js
let developers = ["Karla", "Alex", "Joe", "Thomas"];
```

3. Access programmatically to the third element of the array and print it in the console.

## 💡 Hints:

+ This is the syntax to access an array value: `arrayName[position]` (Remember the position of elements starts in 0, so the position of the first element is 0, the position of the second element is 1, and so on).

+ Remember to access programmatically to the array value and don't print it hard coded.
